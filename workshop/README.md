# Introduction

## Trust in AI

Fairness, robustness, and explainability are key attributes of trusted AI

### Watson OpenScale

Watson OpenScale tracks and measures outcomes from your AI models, and helps ensure they remain fair, explainable and compliant wherever your models were built or are running. OpenScale is designed as an open platform that will operate with various model development environments and various open source tools, including TensorFlow, Keras, SparkML, Seldon, AWS SageMaker, AzureML and more. 

Watson OpenScale provides a set of monitoring and management tools that help you build trust and implement control and governance structures around your AI investments

## Lab Overview

The scenario we will use in this lab is around credit lending. Lenders want to give more loans to a wider variety of customers. To do this, they are turning to complex credit risk machine learning models \(sometimes black box models\) that help determine if those customers are eligible for a loan based on a variety of different features, such as credit history, age, number of dependents, application education, job title, etc. 

As credit risk models expand to use these alternate data sources, we introduce risk that the model may find some unexpected correlations in the data and make biased predictions based on an applicantâ€™s age, gender, or other personal traits.

In this lab will walk through the process of deploying a credit risk model and then monitoring the model to explore the different aspects of trusted AI. By the end of the lab, we will have:

* Deployed a model from development to a runtime environment.
* Monitored the performance \(operational\) of the model over time.
* Tracked the model quality \(accuracy metrics\) over time.
* Identified and explored the fairness of the model as it's receiving new data.
* Understood how the model arrived at its predictions.
* Tracked the robustness of the model.
